# Water Supply and access in Nigeria 
## Overview
This research explores the current state of water supply and access across Nigeria. The focus area include but not limited to: accessibility, Water quality, Treatment method and Health outcomes. The study covered all six geo-political zones with a fair balance of male and female representations. Respondents ranged across young adults to the elderly and majority of the respondents were from the urban area.

## Key KPIs
Demographic KPI : 
1.  Respondents by age bracket.
2.  Gender distribution
4.  Respondents by region ( geopolitical zone)
5.  Total number of respondents.
6.  Urban vs Rural Water Access.

Water Accessibility  : 
6.  Average distance to water source

7.  Percentage of households using piped or borehole water as their primary source. (This will include all the water sources, not just piped or borehole).

8.  Average Weekly household expenses on water.

Water quality and treatment : 
9.  Access to safe and reliable drinking water sources.

10.  Most common modes of treatment.

11.  Percentage of households not treating water before drinking.

12.  Which geopolitical zone is water related sickness prevalent.

## Data Source
The data for this study was collected through a questionnaire form prepared by my team and distributed to respondents across all the six geopolitical zones  in Nigeria.

## Methodology
This was a team work where we explore the state of water accessibility and other related factors in Nigeria. We deliberated about our focus of analysis and we created a questionnaire which was sent out to people across Nigeria to fill. After data collection we performed data processing where we prepared the data for analysis. We analyzed the data and came to conclusion.

## Key insights
•	The main source of water supply is from a borehole with 93 respondents indicating that they use a borehole for their water supply. Furthermore, most respondents shared that they indeed had access to water on their premises with this being answered by 122 persons.

•	Unfortunately, not all the respondents have access to safe sources of water. Treatment practices such as boiling, filtration and chlorine are common but many still do not treat their water, this is indicated by 82 respondents with 55 persons indicating having experience a water-borne illness.

•	Respondents highlighted few challenges affecting their access to clean and reliable water. The most frequent reported issue is the cost.

•	Households using unsafe water are more likely to treat it, but not all persons do.

•	Southwest and north central shows better access to safe water (more boreholes and piped connections).

•	Chlorination mode of treating water is more common in North central and south west.

## Limitation
While this study aims to provide insights into water supply and access across Nigeria, the sample size 0f 150 respondents is not fully representative of the country’s population of over 200 million. time constraints also limited the volume collected. therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalized to the entire Nigerian population.

## Recommendation and Conclusion
•	Invest In safe water infrastructure (especially in the rural areas).

•	Promote low-cost water treatment methods.

•	Launch community education campaigns on water safety.

•	Target zones with high rate of illnesses for intervention.

•	Encourage policies supporting piped and borehole access.
